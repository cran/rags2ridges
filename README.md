**rags2ridges**
---------------

The R-package **rags2ridges** performs L2-penalized estimation of precison (and covariance) matrices. 
The package contains *proper* L2-penalized ML estimators for the precision matrix as well as supporting functions to employ these estimators in a (integrative or meta-analytic) graphical modeling setting. 
The package has a modular setup and features fast and efficient algorithms.

## Installation

The released and tested version of **rags2ridges** is available at
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rags2ridges) (Comprehensive R Archive Network). It can be easily be installed from within R by running

```R
install.packages("rags2ridges")
```

If you wish to install the latest version of **rags2ridges** directly from the master branch here at GitHub, run

```R
#install.packages("devtools")  # Uncomment if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("CFWP/rags2ridges")
```

Note, that this version is in development and is different from the version at CRAN. As such, it may be unstable. Be sure that you have the
[package development prerequisites](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites) if you wish to install the package from the source.

When installed, run `news(package = "rags2ridges")` to view the latest notable changes to **rags2ridges**.
